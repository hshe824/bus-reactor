Bus-Reactor is a React web app that connects to the Translink API to pull liveÂ bus locations and display them on an interactable map. Buses are colour-coded by direction, and display useful route and destination information in a popup when clicked.

NB: Please run this in Google chrome, with a plugin to ensure CORS (eg. [CORS Toggle plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-toggle/jioikioepegflmdnbocfhgmpmopmjkim?hl=en)) so that Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers for CORS are enabled.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
